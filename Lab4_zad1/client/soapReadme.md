## Overview {#doc-overview}

This report was generated by soapcpp2 v2.8.35 for interface file [calc.h](calc.h) with options -r -c -C -L -w 

### Tools

The **wsdl2h** command line tool takes a set of WSDL and XSD files to generate a data binding interface file.  This interface file is similar to a C/C++ header file and contains declarations of C/C++ types and functions with explanatory comments, directives, and annotations.  Types are declared in this interface file as serializable.  Functions are declared as Web service operations for the client and server sides.

The **soapcpp2** command line tool takes an interface file (i.e. a header file) such as [calc.h](calc.h) to generate the data binding implementation.  This implementation includes XML serializers and source code for the client and server side.  An interface file for soapcpp2 can be a regular C/C++ header file with type and function declarations (without code), and include annotations to declare XML schema-related properties.

### Files

The following C source code files were generated by soapcpp2 for interface file [calc.h](calc.h):

- [soapStub.h](soapStub.h) contains an annotated copy of [calc.h](calc.h) and of the imported files (if any), where most of the information in this report [soapReadme.md](soapReadme.md) is sourced from (this header file also #includes "stdsoap2.h")
- [soapH.h](soapH.h) declares allocation and (de)serialization functions for each C/C++ type, to #include in projects (this header file also #includes "soapStub.h")
- [soapC.c](soapC.c) defines allocation and (de)serialization functions for each C/C++ type, to compile with a project
- [soapClient.c](soapClient.c) defines client call stub functions for service invocation, to compile with a project

Also compile stdsoap2.c (and dom.c if XML DOM is used) with a project (or link libgsoapssl.a) and use the following compile-time options:

- `-DWITH_OPENSSL` to enable HTTPS with OpenSSL
- `-DWITH_GNUTLS` to enable HTTPS with GNUTLS
- `-DWITH_DOM` is required when using the WS-Security plugin
- `-DWITH_GZIP` to enable message compression

See the gSOAP documentation for additional options.

### Contents

</table>

<a name="ns2__addResponse"></a>

### `struct ns2__addResponse`

This struct is declared in [calc.h](calc.h) at line 281, is serialized as XSD type *`ns2:addResponse`* and is internally used as the operation response element *`<ns2:addResponse>`* with the response parameters of service operation `ns2__add()`.

[![][1] To top](#)


<a name="ns2__add"></a>

### `struct ns2__add`

This struct is declared in [calc.h](calc.h) at line 281, is serialized as XSD type *`ns2:add`* and is internally used as the operation request element *`<ns2:add>`* with the request parameters of service operation `ns2__add()`.

[![][1] To top](#)


<a name="SOAP_ENV__Header"></a>

### `struct SOAP_ENV__Header`

This struct is declared in [calc.h](calc.h) at line 342, is the SOAP protocol *`<SOAP-ENV:Header>`* element with message-specific child elements that are mandatory to process when attributed with *`mustUnderstand="true"`*.  Headers are usually added and processed by plugins.  To remove the SOAP Header when sending or returning a message, set `soap->header = NULL`.  Use `soap_header(struct soap *soap)` to allocate a `struct SOAP_ENV__Header` which will be pointed to by `soap->header`, then initialize it with `soap_default_SOAP_ENV__Header(soap, soap->header)` and set one or more of its data members (if any):

*No SOAP headers are applicable*

This struct will be auto-generated when it is not explicitly declared in an interface file, and is declared mutable, meaning that multiple declarations in interface files are collected into one structure, and has the following auto-completed declaration in soapStub.h:

    struct SOAP_ENV__Header {
    };

[![][1] To top](#)


<a name="SOAP_ENV__Code"></a>

### `struct SOAP_ENV__Code`

This struct is declared in [calc.h](calc.h) at line 342, is recursive, meaning it may (in)directly reference itself through its (base or derived class) members, and is the SOAP protocol *`<SOAP-ENV:Code>`* element.  This struct is for internal use and will be auto-generated when not explicitly declared.

[![][1] To top](#)


<a name="SOAP_ENV__Detail"></a>

### `struct SOAP_ENV__Detail`

This struct is declared in [calc.h](calc.h) at line 342, is the SOAP protocol *`<SOAP-ENV:Detail>`* element with details returned by a service that triggered the error.  Fault details are added and processed by plugins by setting the `detail` (for SOAP 1.1) or `SOAP_ENV__Detail` (for SOAP 1.2) member of `struct SOAP_ENV__Fault` and then setting one ore more of the detail members:

- `char *__any` catch-all XML in literal XML string, see also <code><a href="#_XML"> _XML </a></code>
- `int __type` element *`<fault>`* serialized with C/C++ type `__type` = `SOAP_TYPE_Name`


This struct will be auto-generated when it is not explicitly declared in an interface file, and is declared mutable, meaning that multiple declarations in interface files are collected into one structure, and has the following auto-completed declaration in soapStub.h:

    struct SOAP_ENV__Detail {
        char *__any;
        /** Any type of element 'fault' assigned to fault with its SOAP_TYPE_T assigned to __type */
        /** Do not create a cyclic data structure throught this member unless SOAP encoding or SOAP_XML_GRAPH are used for id-ref serialization */
        int __type;
        void *fault;
    };

[![][1] To top](#)


<a name="SOAP_ENV__Reason"></a>

### `struct SOAP_ENV__Reason`

This struct is declared in [calc.h](calc.h) at line 342, is the SOAP protocol *`<SOAP-ENV:Reason>`* element.  This struct is for internal use and will be auto-generated when not explicitly declared.

[![][1] To top](#)


<a name="SOAP_ENV__Fault"></a>

### `struct SOAP_ENV__Fault`

This struct is declared in [calc.h](calc.h) at line 342, is the SOAP protocol *`<SOAP-ENV:Fault>`* element with fault information and details returned by a service that triggered the error.  At the server side, a fault can be explicitly set within a service operation by calling and returning:

- `int soap_sender_fault(struct soap *soap, const char *faultstring, const char *XML)` return this error code when the sender is at fault (irrecoverable)
- `int soap_receiver_fault(struct soap *soap, const char *faultstring, const char *XML)` return this error code when the receiver is at fault (recoverable, sender may retry)

A service operation may also return an HTTP status/error code (201 to 999).

At the client side the (proxy) call returns the error code which is also stored in `soap->error`.  The fault structure is pointed to by `soap->fault`.  The fault can be displayed with:

- `void soap_print_fault(struct soap *soap, FILE *fd)` display fault
- `void soap_print_fault_location(struct soap *soap, FILE *fd)` display the location of the fault in the XML message that caused it
- `void soap_sprint_fault(struct soap *soap, char *buf, size_t len)` write fault to buffer
- `void soap_stream_fault(struct soap *soap, std::ostream&)` write fault to stream
- `const char **soap_faultstring(struct soap *soap)` returns a pointer to the SOAP Fault string/reason to get or set this string
- `const char **soap_faultdetail(struct soap *soap)` returns a pointer to the SOAP Fault detail XML to get or set this string

This struct will be auto-generated when it is not explicitly declared in an interface file and is declared mutable, meaning that multiple declarations in interface files are collected into one structure, and has the following auto-completed declaration in soapStub.h:

    struct SOAP_ENV__Fault {
        /** Optional element 'faultcode' of XSD type 'xsd:QName' */
        char *faultcode;
        /** Optional element 'faultstring' of XSD type 'xsd:string' */
        char *faultstring;
        /** Optional element 'faultactor' of XSD type 'xsd:string' */
        char *faultactor;
        /** Optional element 'detail' of XSD type 'SOAP-ENV:Detail' */
        struct SOAP_ENV__Detail *detail;
        /** Optional element 'SOAP-ENV:Code' of XSD type 'SOAP-ENV:Code' */
        struct SOAP_ENV__Code *SOAP_ENV__Code;
        /** Optional element 'SOAP-ENV:Reason' of XSD type 'SOAP-ENV:Reason' */
        struct SOAP_ENV__Reason *SOAP_ENV__Reason;
        /** Optional element 'SOAP-ENV:Node' of XSD type 'xsd:string' */
        char *SOAP_ENV__Node;
        /** Optional element 'SOAP-ENV:Role' of XSD type 'xsd:string' */
        char *SOAP_ENV__Role;
        /** Optional element 'SOAP-ENV:Detail' of XSD type 'SOAP-ENV:Detail' */
        struct SOAP_ENV__Detail *SOAP_ENV__Detail;
    };

## Typedefs {#doc-typedefs}

A typedef type is serializable if its underlying base type is serializable.  Typedefs may declare custom serializers, meaning their underlying types are custom-serialized in XML using serialization rules that differ from the serialization rules of the underlying base type:
<table class="doxtable">
<tr><th> Typedef </th><th> Type </th><th> Declared </th><th> Serializable </th><th> Custom </th></tr>
<tr><td><code><a href="#_QName"> _QName </a></code></td><td><code> char * </code></td><td> calc.h:121 </td><td> yes </td><td> yes </td></tr>
<tr><td><code><a href="#_XML"> _XML </a></code></td><td><code> char * </code></td><td> calc.h:121 </td><td> yes </td><td> yes </td></tr>
</table>

<a name="_QName"></a>

### `_QName`

This typedef is declared in [calc.h](calc.h) at line 121 and is a built-in string type to normalize and serialize a list of space-separated QNames stored in a string, such that namespace prefixes in this string can be used when prefixes have URI entries in the [namespace table](#doc-namespaces)

[![][1] To top](#)


<a name="_XML"></a>

### `_XML`

This typedef is declared in [calc.h](calc.h) at line 121 and is a built-in string type to serialize XML that is literally stored in this string

[![][1] To top](#)


## Summary of Serializable Types {#doc-types}

Each serializable C *Type* with binding name *Name* has a set of auto-generated functions:

- `(Type *)soap_malloc(struct soap*, sizeof(Type))` raw managed allocation of *Type*
- `Type *soap_new_Name(struct soap*, int n)` managed allocation with default initialization of one *Type* when `n` = 1 or array *Type*`[n]` when `n` > 1
- `void soap_default_Name(struct soap*, Type*)` initialize or reset *Type* to default
- `const char *soap_strdup(struct saop*, const char*)` managed duplication of string
- `const wchar_t *soap_wstrdup(struct saop*, const wchar_t*)` managed duplication of wide string
- `int soap_read_Name(struct soap*, Type*)` deserialize *Type* from XML, returns `SOAP_OK` or error code
- `int soap_write_Name(struct soap*, Type*)` serialize *Type* to XML, returns `SOAP_OK` or error code
- `const char *soap_Name2s(struct soap*, Type)` primitive *Type* only, returns string-converted *Type* in temporary string buffer
- `int soap_s2Name(struct soap*, const char*, Type*)` primitive *Type* only, convert string to value, returns `SOAP_OK` or error code

Each *Type* also has a unique type id `SOAP_TYPE_Name` that you can use to serialize `void*` in a struct/class by setting the `int __type` member to this type id.

From the toolkit documentation:

- Set `soap->sendfd = fd` to serialize to an `int fd` file descriptor
- Set `soap->os = &cs` to serialize to a string `const char *cs`, which will be assigned by the engine and set to point to a managed string that is automatically deleted
- Set `soap->recvfd = fd` to deserialize from an `int fd` file descriptor
- Set `soap->is = cs` to deserialize from a `const char *cs` string
- All managed allocated data is freed by `soap_end(soap)` with context `soap`

The table below lists the serializable types by *Type*, binding *Name*, *Kind*, and the XSD data binding type and/or element.  Pointers, arrays, and containers of these types are also serializable:

<table class="doxtable">
<tr><th> C Type </th><th> Name </th><th> Kind </th><th> XSD </th></tr>
<tr><td><code> char </code></td><td><code> byte </code></td><td> char </td><td> xsd:byte </td></tr>
<tr><td><code> int </code></td><td><code> int </code></td><td> int </td><td> xsd:int </td></tr>
<tr><td><code> double </code></td><td><code> double </code></td><td> double </td><td> xsd:double </td></tr>
<tr><td><code><a href="#SOAP_ENV__Fault"> struct SOAP_ENV__Fault </a></code></td><td><code> SOAP_ENV__Fault </code></td><td> struct </td><td>  </td></tr>
<tr><td><code><a href="#SOAP_ENV__Reason"> struct SOAP_ENV__Reason </a></code></td><td><code> SOAP_ENV__Reason </code></td><td> struct </td><td>  </td></tr>
<tr><td><code><a href="#SOAP_ENV__Detail"> struct SOAP_ENV__Detail </a></code></td><td><code> SOAP_ENV__Detail </code></td><td> struct </td><td>  </td></tr>
<tr><td><code><a href="#SOAP_ENV__Code"> struct SOAP_ENV__Code </a></code></td><td><code> SOAP_ENV__Code </code></td><td> struct </td><td>  </td></tr>
<tr><td><code><a href="#SOAP_ENV__Header"> struct SOAP_ENV__Header </a></code></td><td><code> SOAP_ENV__Header </code></td><td> struct </td><td>  </td></tr>
<tr><td><code><a href="#ns2__add"> struct ns2__add </a></code></td><td><code> ns2__add </code></td><td> struct </td><td> ns2:add </td></tr>
<tr><td><code><a href="#ns2__addResponse"> struct ns2__addResponse </a></code></td><td><code> ns2__addResponse </code></td><td> struct </td><td> ns2:addResponse </td></tr>
<tr><td><code><a href="#_XML"> _XML </a></code></td><td><code> _XML </code></td><td> string </td><td> (literal XML string) </td></tr>
<tr><td><code><a href="#_QName"> _QName </a></code></td><td><code> _QName </code></td><td> string </td><td> xsd:QName </td></tr>
<tr><td><code> char * </code></td><td><code> string </code></td><td> string </td><td> xsd:string </td></tr>
</table>

## Schemas and Namespaces {#doc-namespaces}

The following schemas and namespaces are used in addition to the predefined SOAP and built-in XSD namespaces:

- Prefix `ns2` is bound to namespace URI *`urn:calc`* with local element form default *`unqualified`* and attribute form default *`unqualified`*

The following namespace table is saved to calc.nsmap:

    struct Namespace namespaces[] = {
        {"SOAP-ENV", "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/", "http://www.w3.org/*/soap-envelope", NULL},
        {"SOAP-ENC", "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/", "http://www.w3.org/*/soap-encoding", NULL},
        {"xsi", "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", "http://www.w3.org/*/XMLSchema-instance", NULL},
        {"xsd", "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema", "http://www.w3.org/*/XMLSchema", NULL},
        {"ns2", "urn:calc", NULL, NULL},
        {NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL}
    };

The table binds XML namespace prefixes (first column) to namespace URIs (second column), similar to xmlns:prefix="URI" in XML.  The third column is a URI pattern with `*` wildcards that is also accepted as a valid namespace URI for inbound XML messages.  The fourth column is NULL.  This table is globally defined for the gSOAP engine.  The engine context will look for it unless you compiled the gSOAP source codes with `-DWITH_NONAMESPACES`.  You must assign this or another namespace table with `soap_set_namespaces(struct soap *soap, struct Namespace *namespaces)` after initializing the context and before processing XML.

## Web Client Operations {#doc-client}

### Operation `ns2__add()`

This service operation is declared in [calc.h](calc.h) at line 277 and has the following properties:

- SOAP 1.1 protocol
- SOAP document style
- SOAP http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/
- SOAP action ""
- SOAP response action "Response"
- Default service endpoint URL "http://localhost:1234"
- Operation namespace prefix `ns2` and URI "[urn:calc](#doc-namespaces)"

To invoke this service operation, use the following auto-generated function declared in [soapStub.h](soapStub.h) and defined in [soapClient.c](soapClient.c):

    SOAP_FMAC5 int SOAP_FMAC6 soap_call_ns2__add(struct soap *soap, const char *soap_endpoint, const char *soap_action, double a, double b, double *result);

where:

- `struct soap *soap` is the context
- `const char *soap_endpoint` is the endpoint URL (or list of space-separated URLs) or pass NULL to use the default endpoint(s)
- `const char *soap_action` is the SOAP action header or pass NULL to use the default action (recommended)
- `double a` is required
- `double b` is required
- `double *result` is the service operation response, which is a non-NULL pointer to a `double` that the client provides with the call and is populated by the service operation as the result of the call

This function returns `SOAP_OK` and sets the last parameter `result` to the result, or returns an error code
